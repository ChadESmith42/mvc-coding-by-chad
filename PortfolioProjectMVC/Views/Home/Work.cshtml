                <p class="text-left">My background is in Geographic Information Systems, or GIS. Prior to beginning my journey into Web Development, I created tons of geospatial products. The best ones don't just display data. They <strong>tell stories</strong>. So here's my attempt to use some open-source web-mapping components to create a story-map and tell my story.</p>

                <p class="text-left">If you like Old School Games, you'll love this. I built a Snake Game using an online tutorial (<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/think-like-a-programmer-how-to-build-snake-using-only-javascript-html-and-css-7b1479c3339e">here</a>). The game uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I modified the tutorial to 1) add a "New Game" button, 2) split the JavaScript from the HTML, and 3) use "WASD" instead of arrows to avoid page scrolling issues. </p>

                <p class="text-left">I built this mapviewer using HTML5, CSS3, and MapBox GL JavaScript library. The page references an Open Data Rest point for Dangerous Buildings in Kansas City, Missouri. The dataset is updated daily (according to data.kcmo.gov). I wanted to achieve three things with this project:</p>
                    <ol class="text-left"> 
                    <li>make a live map,</li>
                    <li>use minimal technology (HTML/CSS/JS only),</li>
                    <li>and provide a useful product using civic data.</li>

                <p class="text-left">I built this site for my final project as a student at Centriq Training's Career Program for Full-Stack Web Developers. The project required that I build a reservation system for a pet resort. Customers can register themselves and their pets, create and edit pets, and create, edit, and delete reservations. Customers should only see their own information and pets. Employees can only see pets and reservations. Employees can create and edit pet notes. Customers and employees can create, edit, and delete their profiles. Admins have full CRUD, with the exception of pets. Pets get a soft delete by changing their status to inactive.</p>
