        <p>
            With over 10 years in Geographic Information Systems, I realized I was missing the front-end of the GIS Full-Stack: web development. I began the <a href="https://www.centriq.com/">Centriq Career Training Program</a> to close that gap. In the process, I discovered I enjoy coding and developing much more than I anticipated.

        <h2>Fun Projects</h2>
        <p>I like to use my development skills to make fun side projects. How better to practice than by expressing your personality and likes at the same time?</p>
